C'est la raison pour laquelle PorterStemmer ne g√©n√®re pas souvent des tiges qui sont de vrais mots anglais. Il ne garde pas de table de recherche pour les stems r√©els du mot mais applique des r√®gles algorithmiques pour g√©n√©rer des stems. Il utilise les r√®gles pour d√©cider s'il est sage de supprimer un suffixe.

    "Le clustering Kmeans est l'un des algorithmes de clustering les plus populaires et g√©n√©ralement la premi√®re chose que les praticiens appliquent lors de la r√©solution des t√¢ches de clustering pour se faire une id√©e de la structure de l'ensemble de donn√©es. Le but des kmeans est de regrouper les points de donn√©es en sous-groupes distincts qui ne se chevauchent pas. Cela fait un tr√®s bon travail lorsque les grappes ont une sorte de formes sph√©riques. Cependant, il souffre car les formes g√©om√©triques des grappes s'√©cartent des formes sph√©riques. De plus, il n'apprend pas non plus le nombre de clusters √† partir des donn√©es et n√©cessite qu'il soit pr√©d√©fini. Pour √™tre un bon praticien, il est bon de conna√Ætre les hypoth√®ses derri√®re les algorithmes / m√©thodes afin d'avoir une assez bonne id√©e de la force et de la faiblesse de chaque m√©thode. Cela vous aidera √† d√©cider quand utiliser chaque m√©thode et dans quelles circonstances. Dans cet article, nous avons couvert √† la fois les forces, les faiblesses,\n",
    "#### Voici les principaux points √† retenir:\n",
    "#### Mettre √† l'√©chelle / normaliser les donn√©es lors de l'application de l'algorithme kmeans.\n",
    "#### La m√©thode du coude dans la s√©lection du nombre de clusters ne fonctionne g√©n√©ralement pas car la fonction d'erreur diminue de mani√®re monotone pour tous les k s.\n",
    "#### Kmeans donne plus de poids aux plus gros clusters.\n",
    "#### Kmeans suppose des formes sph√©riques de clusters (avec un rayon √©gal √† la distance entre le centre de gravit√© et le point de donn√©es le plus √©loign√©) et ne fonctionne pas bien lorsque les clusters sont de formes diff√©rentes telles que les clusters elliptiques.\n",
    "#### S'il y a chevauchement entre les clusters, les kmeans n'ont pas de mesure intrins√®que de l'incertitude car les exemples appartiennent √† la r√©gion de chevauchement afin de d√©terminer pour quel cluster attribuer chaque point de donn√©es.\n",
    "#### Kmeans peut toujours regrouper les donn√©es m√™me si elles ne peuvent pas √™tre regroup√©es, telles que les donn√©es provenant de distributions uniformes ."
